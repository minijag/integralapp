# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Best way to start this project, is type

### `npm run storybook`

Hopefully it will run the storybook webserver and frontend component design application.  Where you can find three types of components Following, Timeline, and Tweet.
Hopefully I dont have any global dependencies taking care of anything for me.  And it will run smoothly for you

If youre interested in where my work is, its in ./stories and you can see how each component is built.  Storybook uses the .stories.jsx to generate the 'tests'
